# 32. implement `Promise.all()`
Promise.all is a method in JavaScript used to handle multiple promises concurrently. It takes an iterable (such as an array) of promises and returns a single promise. This returned promise resolves when all the promises in the iterable have resolved, or rejects if any of the promises in the iterable reject.

### Key Features of `Promise.all`

1. **Concurrent Execution**:
    
    * `Promise.all` runs multiple promises in parallel.
    * It waits for all the promises to settle (either resolved or rejected).
2. **Resolved Value**:
    
    * When all promises resolve, `Promise.all` resolves with an array of their results, maintaining the order of the original promises.
    * Example: `Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((values) => { console.log(values); });`
    * If `promise1` resolves to `value1` and `promise2` resolves to `value2`, the output will be `[value1, value2]`.
3. **Rejection Handling**:
    
    * If any promise in the iterable rejects, `Promise.all` immediately rejects with the reason of the first promise that rejected.
    * Example: `Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).catch((error) => { console.log(error); });`
    * If `promise1` rejects with an `error1`, `Promise.all` will reject with `error1`.

#

### Problem Description

> The Promise.all() method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises

source - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)

Could you write your own `all()` ? which should works the same as `Promise.all()`

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {Array<any>} promises - notice input might have non-Promises
 * @return {Promise<any[]>}
 */
function all(promises) {
  if (promises.length === 0) {
    return Promise.resolve([]);
  }

  const results = Array(promises.length);
  let count = 0;

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    promises.forEach((promise, i) => {
      if (!(promise instanceof Promise)) {
        promise = Promise.resolve(promise);
      }

      promise
        .then((res) => {
          results[i] = res;
          count++;

          if (count === promises.length) {
            resolve(results);
          }
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          reject(err);
        });
    });
  });
}
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo'));
const promise3 = fetch('https://api.example.com/data');

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((values) => {
    console.log(values); // [3, 'foo', Response object from fetch]
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('One of the promises failed:', error);
  });
```

### Use Cases

* **Aggregating Results**: When you need to wait for multiple asynchronous operations to complete before proceeding, such as fetching data from multiple sources.
* **Parallel Execution**: When operations do not depend on each other and can be executed in parallel for efficiency.

### Important Notes

* If the iterable passed to `Promise.all` is empty, it returns a promise that resolves to an empty array.
* The order of results in the resolved array corresponds to the order of the promises passed to `Promise.all`.

By leveraging `Promise.all`, developers can handle multiple asynchronous operations efficiently, ensuring that subsequent code execution waits until all specified promises have been settled.
