# 151. implement Array.prototype.map()

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-Array-prototype-map

#

### Problem Description

Please implement your own [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).

```js
[1, 2, 3].myMap((num) => num * 2);
// [2,4,6]
```

#

### Understanding the problem

Write a prototype method for `Array` that returns a new array populated with the result of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

#

### Approach

Create an empty array to store the result. Iterate through every items in the calling array. At each item, call the provided callback and pass the item, its index and the calling array as arguments to the callback; store the return value in the result array.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è In the initial attempt, I didn't handle the following cases:

1. Besides the callback function, our function can also take in a second argument, the optional `thisArg`, when it is provided, the callback function should be executed with the provided context.
2. The callback might alter the length of the calling array, resulting in an infinite loop.
3. The calling array is a sparse array. A sparse array is an array in which indices are not contiguous. For instance, `[1, 3]` is a sparse array and the indices are `0, 2`, index `1` is not in the array. Our function should ignore indices that are not present in the calling array.

### Solution

```js
Array.prototype.myMap = function (callback, thisArg) {
  // Store the length of the original array to avoid potential infinity loop
  // when the length of the calling array is altered on the fly.
  const length = this.length;
  // Initialize the resulting array to be the same size as the calling array.
  const result = new Array(length);

  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    // Ensure index is in the array. myMap should ignore
    // indices that are not in the array.
    if (i in this) {
      // Execute the callback with proper context and store its return value in the
      // result array.
      result[i] = callback.call(thisArg || this, this[i], i, this);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

// Usage 
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const mappedArr = arr.myMap((el) => el * 2);
console.log(mappedArr); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### Explanation 

This JavaScript code is a custom implementation of the `Array.prototype.map()`function, which is a built-in method in JavaScript that creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `Array.prototype.myMap = function (callback, thisArg) {...}` This line is extending the Array prototype with a new method called `myMap`. This method takes two arguments: a `callback` function and an optional `thisArg`  object that will be used as `this`] when executing the callback.

2. `const length = this.length;`: This line is storing the length of the array on which `myMap` was called. This is done to avoid potential infinite loops if the array's length is changed during the execution of `myMap`.

3. `const result = new Array(length);`: This line is initializing a new array with the same length as the original array. This will be the array that gets returned at the end.

4. The `for` loop: This loop iterates over each element in the original array.

5. `if (i in this) {...}`: This line checks if the current index exists in the original array. This is done because in JavaScript, arrays can have "holes" (i.e., indices that have never been assigned a value).

6. `result[i] = callback.call(thisArg || this, this[i], i, this);`: This line is calling the `callback` function with the current element, its index, and the original array as arguments. The result is stored in the corresponding index of the `result`array. 

   - `result[i]`: This is the assignment statement that assigns the return value of the callback function to the `i`-th index of the `result` array. It ensures that the return value is stored at the correct position in the resulting array.

   - `callback`: This is the function that is passed as an argument to the `myMap` function. It is the function that will be executed on each element of the array. `(el) => el * 2`

   - `call()`: `call()` is a method available on JavaScript functions. It allows you to invoke a function and specify the value of `this` inside that function. In this case, `callback.call(...)` is used to execute the `callback` function.

   - `thisArg || this`: This is the value that will be used as the `this` value inside the `callback` function. The `thisArg` argument is optional, so if it is not provided, `this` (referring to the calling array) will be used as the `this` value.

   - `this[i]`: This is the current element of the array that is being processed by the `callback` function. It is passed as the first argument to the `callback` function.

   - `i`: This is the index of the current element in the array. It is passed as the second argument to the `callback` function.

   - `this`: This refers to the calling array itself. It is passed as the third ar gument to the `callback` function.`[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]`

7. `return result;`: This line returns the new array after the `for` loop has finished executing. `[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]`
