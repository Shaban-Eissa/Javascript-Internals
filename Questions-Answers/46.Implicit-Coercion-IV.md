# 46. Implicit Coercion IV

### Problem

### Problem Description

What does the code snippet below output by `console.log`?

```js
const foo = [0];
if (foo) {
  console.log(foo == true);
} else {
  console.log(foo == false);
}
```

#

### Answer

```js
const foo = [0];
if (foo) {
  console.log(foo == true); // false
} else {
  // Never reached, because an array always evaluates to `true`
  // when passed to a conditional statement.
  console.log(foo == false);
}
```

### Explanation

`foo == true` returns `false`, because when the two operands are of different types and one of them is a `Boolean`, the `==` operator converts the `Boolean` to `1` if it is `true` and `0` if it is `false`, and the array `[0]` is converted into a string using `Array`'s `toString()` method, so `foo == true` becomes `'0' == 1`, finally, `'0'` is coerced to a numeric value, since when comparing a number to a string, `==` tries to convert the string to a number.
