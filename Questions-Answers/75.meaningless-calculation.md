### Problem Description

What does the code snippet below output by `console.log`?

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const num = +((~~!+[])+(~~!+[])+[]+(~~!+[]))
console.log(num)
```

#

### Answer

```
21
```

### Explanation

`+((~~!+[])+(~~!+[])+[]+(~~!+[]))` is equivalent to `+(~~!+[] + ~~!+[] + [] + ~~!+[])`.

1. First, JavaScript evaluates `~~!+[]`, starting with `+[]`.

   1. `+[]` evaluates to `0`, because the unary plus `+` convert a operand into a number. When the operand is an array, the array is first converted to a string and then to a number. The empty array is first converted to `''`, then the empty string is converted to `0`.

   2. Then `!0` evaluates to `true`, because the logical NOT(`!`) operator returns `true` if the operand is not a Boolean value and cannot be converted to `true`.

   3. `~~` is a double [NOT bitwise operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_NOT). The first `~` operator forces the operand to an integer, then inverts the lowest 31 bits. Then the second `~` operator inverts the bits back, so we will get an integer. In our case, `~true` returns `-2`, then `~-2` returns `1`.

2. Now we get `1 + 1 + [] + 1`. JavaScript then evaluates from left to right.

   1. `1 + 1 + [] + 1` = `2 + [] + 1`.

   2. The empty array is converted to a string value: `''`. When one of the operands is a string, the addition operator `+` tries string concatenation before numeric addition. Therefore, we got `'2' + 1`.

   3. Finally, `'2' + 1` returns `'21'`.
