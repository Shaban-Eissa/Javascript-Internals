### Problem Description

What does the code snippet below output by `console.log`?

```js
if (
  function foo() {
    console.log('BFE');
  }
) {
  console.log('dev');
}
foo();
```

#

### Answer

```
"dev"
Error
```

### Explanation

When a function is created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct, it is a function expression. So in the code snippet above, `function foo() {}` is a **named function expression**, where `foo` is the function name. It is similar to:

```js
const bar = function foo() {};
```

Since the function name `foo` is local only to the function body, trying to call `foo()` in the global scope  
ends up with the error: `foo is not defined`.
