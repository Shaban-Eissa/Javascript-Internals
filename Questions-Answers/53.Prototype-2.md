### Problem Description

What does the code snippet below output by `console.log`?

```js
function F() {
  this.foo = 'bar';
}

const f = new F();
console.log(f.prototype);
```

### Answer

```
undefined
```

### Explanation

The `prototype` property is only available on functions, or more specifically, on `Function` objects. The value of the `prototype` property is an object containing a `constructor` property, which points to the original constructor function. When you create an object with `new`, `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__`. Therefore, the object `f` doesn't have a `prototype` property, but a `__proto__` property, which is a reference to `F.prototype`.
