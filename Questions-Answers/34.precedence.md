### Problem Description

What does the code snippet below output by `console.log`?

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
let a = 1
console.log(a +++ a)

let b = 1
console.log(b + + + b)

let c = 1
console.log(c --- c)

let d = 1
console.log(d - - - d)
```

#

### Answer

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
let a = 1
console.log(a +++ a) // 3

let b = 1
console.log(b + + + b) // 2

let c = 1
console.log(c --- c) // 1

let d = 1
console.log(d - - - d) // 0
```

### Explanation

- `a +++ a` returns `3`, because in this expression postfix increment operator `... ++` has the highest precedence, therefore JavaScript first evaluates `a ++`. `a +++ a` is same as `a++ + a`.
  Postfix increment increments and returns the value before incrementing:

  ```js
  let x = 3;
  let y = x++;

  console.log(x); // 4
  console.log(y); // 3
  ```

  Thus `a++` returns `1` and `a` becomes `2`, and `a++ + a` returns `3`.

  The same logic applies to the `c --- c` case. `c --- c` is same as `c-- - c`. `c--` returns `1` and `c` becomes `0`, so the final result is `1`.

- `b + + + b` returns `2`, because `+ +` is not increment operator and the unary plus operator `+` has the highest precedence, therefore JavaScript evaluates `+ b` first. `b + + + b` is same as `b + + (+b)`.
  The unary plus operator `+` tries to convert its operand into a number if it isn't already. Since `b` is already a number, the expression becomes `b + + b`. `b + + b` is identical to `b + +b`, so the final result is `2`.

  The same logic applies to `d - - - d`, which is identical to `d - - (-d)`. The unary negation operator `-` negates its operand, so `-d` returns `-1` and the expression becomes `d - - (-1)`, which is same as `d - -(-1)`. So the final result is `0`.
