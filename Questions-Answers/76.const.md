### Problem Description

What does the code snippet below output by `console.log`?

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
function func() {
  const a = b = c = 1;
}
func();
console.log(typeof a, typeof b, typeof c);
```

#

### Answer

```
"undefined","number","number"
```

### Explanation

- `typeof a` returns `"undefined"`, because constants are block-scoped. We declared `a` with `const` inside the function `func()`, therefore `a` is local only to the `func() {}` block. When we access `a` outside of that scope, i.e., in the global scope, `a` is `undefined`.

- `typeof b` and `typeof c` both return `"number"`, because `b` and `c` are declared globally.

  `const a = b = c = 1` is equivalent to the following:

  ```js
  c = 1;
  b = c;

  const a = b;
  ```

  Since there are no declarations for `b` and `c`, both of them are created as global variables. Therefore, the code snippet in the problem statement is essentially the same as the following:

  ```js
  var b;
  var c;

  function func() {
    c = 1;
    b = c;

    const a = b;
  }
  func();
  console.log(typeof a, typeof b, typeof c);
  ```

  First, we call `func()`; `c` and `b` are assigned to `1`. Then we log the type of `b` and `c`. Since now `b` and `c` are pointing to the number value `1`, `typeof b` and `typeof c` return `"number"`.

  It's worth noting, when declaring a constant, we must specify its value in the same statement in which it is declared:

  ```js
  // throws an error
  // Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

  const a;
  ```
