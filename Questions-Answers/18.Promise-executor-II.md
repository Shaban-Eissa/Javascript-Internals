### Problem Description

What does the code snippet below output by `console.log`?

```js
const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
const p2 = new Promise((resolve) => resolve(p1));
const p3 = Promise.resolve(p1);
const p4 = p2.then(() => new Promise((resolve) => resolve(p3)));
const p5 = p4.then(() => p4);

console.log(p1 == p2);
console.log(p1 == p3);
console.log(p3 == p4);
console.log(p4 == p5);
```

#

### Answer

```js
const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
const p2 = new Promise((resolve) => resolve(p1));
const p3 = Promise.resolve(p1);
const p4 = p2.then(() => new Promise((resolve) => resolve(p3)));
const p5 = p4.then(() => p4);

console.log(p1 == p2); // false
console.log(p1 == p3); // true
console.log(p3 == p4); // false
console.log(p4 == p5); // false
```

### Explanation

- `p1 == p2` is `false`, because `p1` and `p2` reference two different Promise objects.
- `p1 == p3` is `true`, because when `Promise.resolve(value)` receives a Promise object as argument, it returns that Promise object.
- `p3 == p4` is `false`, because `Promise.prototype.then()` returns a new Promise. If the `onFulfilled` handler returns an already resolved Promise, the Promise returned by `then()` gets resolved with that Promise's value as its value.
- `p4 == p5` is `false`, because `Promise.prototype.then()` returns a new Promise.
