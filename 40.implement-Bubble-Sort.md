# 40. implement Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.

#

### Problem Description

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort), which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it **in-place**, no need to return anything.

**Follow-up**

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 */
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  let hasNoSwaps;
  for (let i = arr.length; i >= 0; i--) {
    hasNoSwaps = true;
    for (let j = 0; j < i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
        hasNoSwaps = false;
      }
    }
    if (hasNoSwaps) {
      break;
    }
  }
}

// Usage 
console.log(bubbleSort([37, 45, 29, 8, 12, 88, -3])); // [-3, 8, 12, 29, 37, 45, 88]
console.log(bubbleSort([8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
console.log(bubbleSort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

#### Use Cases:

1. **Small Data Sets**: It can be useful for small datasets or when the simplicity of the implementation is more critical than performance.
2. **Nearly Sorted Data**: If the data is nearly sorted or has only a few elements out of order, Bubble Sort can be efficient.
